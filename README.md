Ever since starting my journey as a software engineer, I have been excited to develop solutions to real-world issues, especially those I face in my role as a Social Prescriber/Link worker 🔗

⁉ What is it?
I have created a tool that can assist patients who are on the waiting list for a social prescribing appointment. It can signpost to local services to assist with housing, mental health, benefits and social isolation.

Why? 🏥
Working within social prescribing, I am aware of the pressures on the NHS, and the effects of waiting lists. Therefore, this tool helps to guide patients towards a solution whilst they wait for an appointment.

How? 💻
The tool uses Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) to read an external database, and initialise a Patient class for each user. Users must validate their email in order to access the tool.

Benefits: 👍
Previously, any support offered to patients on the waiting list would not have been tailored to their individual needs. Additionally, any support to patients on the waiting list previously would not have been automated - this tool will save clinicians time, and provide faster support to patients.
